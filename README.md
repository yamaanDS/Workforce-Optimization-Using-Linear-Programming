This project demonstrates a classic **workforce planning problem** solved using **Linear Programming** and implemented in **Microsoft Excel Solver**.

## üîç Problem Statement

A company must determine the minimum number of workers to hire, given that:
- Each worker works **5 consecutive days**.
- Daily worker demand varies throughout the week.
- The goal is to **minimize the total number of workers** hired while meeting daily demand.

This type of problem is widely used in:
- Industrial & Production Engineering (IPE)
- Operations Research
- Workforce Scheduling

## üìä Solution Overview

- **Tool used**: Microsoft Excel + Solver Add-in
- **Model type**: Linear Programming
- **Objective**: Minimize total number of workers
- **Constraints**: Daily demand coverage, non-negative decision variables
